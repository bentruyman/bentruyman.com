<h1>Résumé</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  I'm a programmer with over 10 years of experience fiddling with various web
  technologies. I enjoy taking calculated risks by pushing the boundaries of
  what's thought is possible by working closely with my team and never settling
  for the status quo. My focus is in developing scalable and maintainable
  application architectures by invoking industry best practices, design
  patterns, and creativity. I measure my work not in
  <acronym title="source lines of code">SLOC</acronym> but rather quality,
  simplicity, portability, and maintainability.

<ul class="disc">
  <li>
    Designed a scalable JavaScript module management framework with 100% test
    coverage that enforced an architecture of highly decoupled modules that
    interfaced with the client's content management system. This was
    accomplished by implementing patterns and technologies such as pub/sub,
    middleware, sandboxing, and require.js. This library was later refactored
    to remove the require.js dependency making it completely library agnostic.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created and helped lead the development of a responsive design framework for
    a Fortune 100 brand to be used by 50+ developers. The framework made use of
    a custom designed grid system, icon font, SVG assets, touch/feature
    detection, and a responsive JavaScript framework to conditionally invoke
    behavior based on device profile.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created a custom designed style framework by adapting various open-source
    projects such as HTML5 Boilerplate and Normalize.css as well as a custom
    grid system developed to be extended to allow for responsive design should
    the requirement be needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lead frontend developement of a major Fortune 100 brand's website. Adapted
    our internal frontend coding conventions and best practices document to
    provide the client's several dozens of developers with the resource they
    require to ensure code consistency and quality across several work streams.
    Also utilized Grunt and JSHint to help validate code consistency based on
    our document's guidelines.
  </li>
  <li>
    Responsible for performance management of four developers by helping guide 
    career direction, biweekly/monthly 1x1 meetings, establishing goals, and
    annual reviews.

</p>
<ul class="disc">
  <li>
    Developed a 44-page internal frontend coding conventions and best practices
    document with the goal of standardizing and ensuring consistent code style
    and quality based on personal experience and industry standards. Everything
    from how <code>for</code> loops should be written to email development.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developed a social application for Budweiser's "Grab Some Buds" campaign to
    enable users to schedule Facebook events on Budweiser.com by creating a
    roster of friends suggested based on relationship and interaction activity.
    The application leveraged CSS3 and the Facebook JavaScript client library.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created a complex product finder tool that utilized AJAX and Canvas to
    create a high-performance application that worked not only on desktops but
    also popular tablets to find faucets and accessory products. The whole
    tablet part was out-of-scope, but we knew we could do it.
  </li>
  <li>

    client's version control system to ensure the greatest amount of code reuse
    across their web properties.

    of complex product finder tools to help customers better discover and
    eventually convert by purchasing said products. Also implemented an
    analytics abstraction framework that included both Google Analytics and
    (now) Adobe SiteCatalyst to help enable best coding practices while making
    it trivial for analysts to further add other tagging strategies. Because who
