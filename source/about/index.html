<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>
  The name is Ben Truyman (pronounced like Truman). My middle name is “Lee”
  which, I guess, makes my initials BLT. Sandwiches aside, I’m also a programmer
  living in the city of Chicago. Professionally, I’m usually doing web-related
  things for a handful of large brands. In my free time, I’m usually neck deep
  in a Node.js playground tinkering with NoSQL databases and “unproven” and
  “silly” technologies. I try to bring the results of my tinkering into my
  professional work by assessing risks and benefits — but always trying to push
  the boundaries of what we think is possible. The status quo is quite boring.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
  Giving back. I’ve been the beneficiary of tens of thousands of hours of work
  yielded by thousands of developers across the world in the form of open-source
  software — it’s time to give back. I’ve landed a couple commits to a few
  repos, but it pales in comparison to those I most look up to. Aside from
  digital charity, I also plan to give back IRL by volunteering at one of
  Inspiration Corp’s kitchens regularly.
