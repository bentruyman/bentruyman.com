<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>
  The name is Ben Truyman (pronounced like Truman). My middle name is “Lee”
  which, I guess, makes my initials BLT. Sandwiches aside, I’m also a programmer
  living in the city of Chicago. Professionally, I’m usually doing web-related
  things for a handful of large brands. In my free time, I’m usually neck deep
  in a Node.js playground tinkering with NoSQL databases and “unproven” and
  “silly” technologies. I try to bring the results of my tinkering into my
  professional work by assessing risks and benefits — but always trying to push
  the boundaries of what we think is possible as I hope my history will show.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> — I <i class="icon-heart"></i> the Internet.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>1992 – 1995</dt>
  <dd>
    My grandfather acquired a decommissioned Commodore 64 from the school he had
    taught at — it becomes my first computer. With only a manual teaching how to
    write Commodore BASIC, I spent hours in the basement writing code that would
    play siren noises and move cars around on the screen while using the
    joystick. I sure do miss <code>goto</code> statements.

  <dt>1995 – 1997</dt>
  <dd>
    Once again, my grandfather helps further develop my programming abilities by
    being one of the first in the family to have Internet access. Just as I'd
    spend hours on my Commodore 64, I spent even more in this nascent World Wide
    Web. I began learning HTML through the help of an early WYSIWYG called
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HotDog">HotDog</a>. I drag and dropped
    things onto a page, hopped over to the code view, tweaked some code, and
    began to understand the hows and whys of building a basic web page. The
    first page I built was a green text on yellow background page and a single
    <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> element with the text that read "Will the Packers
    win the Super Bowl?". And they did. Those were the days. That, and
    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLvblD6QQdk">VRML</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt>1997 – 2001</dt>
  <dd>
    I'm finally fortunate enough to get a "real" computer of my own, and my
    trusty companion the Commodore 64 made its way into a box in the closet. I
    begin venturing into new territory such as "DHTML" and CSS. I used my newly
    learned programming knowledge to make a simple HTML-based game for our 5th
    grade D.A.R.E class in which the user would have to make a series of correct
    decisions, or face an undesired outcome.
  </dd>
  <dt>2002 – 2005</dt>
  <dd>
    Once HTML, CSS, and JavaScript became a boring, I needed to find a way to
    stop using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s for all of my persistent navigation
    and repeated regions. PHP came into the picture with its ability to
    "include" other PHP files. But as I quickly learned, PHP was much more than
    that. I started tinkering with things like
    <a href="http://www.phpnuke.org/">PHP-Nuke</a>, and quickly found my self
    having to become familiar with even more goodies like MySQL. Eventually, I'd
    need to obtain a legitimate domain name and be able to host all of these fun
    things. I register <a href="http://theblt.com/">theblt.com</a> in 2002 and
    find a cheap $4/month shared host with cPanel installed and start throwing
    up some of my side projects (like my highschool rugby team's
    <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031214100842/http://www.theblt.com/ohsr/?page=roster">website</a>
    ). However, that wasn't enough. Things like ActionScript became increasingly
    intriguing and I began my exploration into Flash development.

    After graduating college, it was time to start evaluating my options for a
    college education. I ended up settling on the Illinois Institute of Art —
    Chicago, beginning the next chapter of my life in this great city. Outside
    of the typical classwork, I continued my exploration of ActionScript, PHP,
    and MySQL. I took my learnings and created a text-based RPG built using PHP,
    MySQL, and XML for our "Introduction to Web Scripting" class. For another
    project, I created an app that allowed users to create pixels on a board,
    drawing pictures. However, the catch was that each pixel had a message
    encoded in it that would reveal itself in a modal window when the user
    clicked it. It was really interesting to see other students in the class
    collaboratively drawing pictures on the board, and leaving funny messages
    and various inside jokes about other professors on the pixels themselves.
    And when I wanted to have a little fun, I made
    <a href="/assets/swf/streetfighter.swf">silly animations</a> with roommates
    and classmates in Flash. For my capstone project, I built a task manager web
    app utilizing ideas taught by David Allen's GTD framework. Late into my
    college career, I was offerred an internship at
    <a href="http://criticalmass.com/">Critical Mass</a> which I immediately and
    excitedly took.

    While I started making minor updates to QVC.com's billing page and
    developing retention emails for grocery chains you probably shop at, I began
    to learn the ropes of agency life while slowly progressing to more
    interesting projects. I worked my way up from a <strong>Web
    Developer</strong> position up to a senior level spot by assisting in
    developing client relationships and directing the technical direction of the
    projects I was fortunate enough to be involved with. Eventually, I moved
    into a <strong>Technology Lead</strong> position where I provided the
    opportunity to further my soft skills and architect various complex
    solutions for some Fortune 500 brands. But in my spare time, I was toying
    with silly Node.js projects trying to better understand various architectual
    design patterns and refining my code to be as simple yet solution-oriented
    as possible. While the early days of Node.js were rough and unpredictable,
    it became a platform that taught me more about JavaScript than any other
    tutorial on the Internet ever would — and I encouraged anyone interested in
    refining their JavaScript abilities to partake in this quickly evolving
    medium. And, to this day, I continue to tinker in Node.js and try to bring
    as many inspirational pieces into my everyday work whenever appropriate.
    It's far more than a platform built for highly concurrent asynchronous
    applications, it's a beautiful learning tool most developers could tinker
    with.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
  Giving back. I’ve been the beneficiary of tens of thousands of hours of work
  yielded by thousands of developers across the world in the form of open-source
  software — it’s time to give back. I’ve landed a couple commits to a few
  repos, but it pales in comparison to those I most look up to. Aside from
  digital charity, I also plan to give back IRL by volunteering at one of
  Inspiration Corp’s kitchens regularly.
